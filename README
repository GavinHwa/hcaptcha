What is Captcha

  CAPTCHA is an acronym for 
  "Completely Automatic Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart".
  It is a task, that human can easily solve, but computer not.
  
  It is used as a challenge-response to ensure that the individual submitting 
  information is a human and not an automated process. Typically, a captcha is 
  used with form submissions where authenticated users are not necessary, 
  but you want to prevent spam submissions.
